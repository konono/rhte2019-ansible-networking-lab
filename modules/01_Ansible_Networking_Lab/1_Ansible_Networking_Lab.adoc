= Ansible Networking Automation

== Part 1: Explore the environment with Ansible·

=== Part 1 Overview

- Explore the environment with shell and Ansible commands·
- Investigate Ansible's configuration and Inventory
- Connect to the Cisco Routers using Ansible·

=== Lab Overview

Financial Services company FinTech provides back-end services for their clients in the
Financial Services industry. Unfortunately a widespread global attack on Cisco Routers
has disrupted their network infrastructure and broken a key customer facing application.

Your role, as a  *Red Hat Ansible Networking Consultant*, is to regain control of the network infrastructure, restore network services,
and protect against further attacks. FinTech have provided Red Hat with an outline of key steps for this engagement.

* Assess the current state of the Networking Infrastructure
** Explore the existing level of connectivity and router configuration
* Preserve for InfoSec as forensics the current configurations of the routers
** Backup both routers current configurations
* Push legal warnings to the routers MOTD (_Message of the Day_)
* Re-establish connectivity between the 2 FinTech Data Centers
** Setup a networking tunnel between the 2 sites (GRE)
** Restore routing between the 2 sites
* Test the application now works as expected
** Can the application front-end now access the remote data center hosting the
application

As an optional assignment, or stretch goal, FinTech would then like to:

* Enhance the legal warnings to the routers MOTD (_Message of the Day_)
* Create a role for the GRE Tunnel setup
* Create a role for the Routing configuration setup

=== Topology

FinTech's topology is quite simple with 2 Data Centers: DC1 and DC2 which lack
their own dedicated private inter-connection. Traffic between the 2 sites is
routed across the Internet in a networking *Tunnel* created between 2 Cisco
routers, one on each site. This GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) Tunnel between the 2 sites allows traffic to be simply routed back and forward between the 2 data Centers as if they had a dedicated connection between the 2 sites.


These routers have been hacked in a recent global attack aimed at publicly
exposed Cisco routers. Since then site-to-site communication has been broken
though insecure public Internet access exists to all externally exposed
machines.

[NOTE]
====
All 4 machines have publicly exposed IP addresses

* DC1 (Date Center 1)
** `ansible` - the control node, and application front-end
** `rtr1` - a cisco router
* DC2 (Data Center 2)
** `backend` - the application itself
** `rtr2` - a cisco router
====

=== Goals

* Familiarize yourself with using Ansible in a Networking Context
* Use `network_cli` to allow Ansible to communicate with network devices
* Use `ios_facts` to see how facts are gathered from networking devices
* Use `ios_config` to configure the routers
* Use `ios_command` as an example of a Networking Command Module
* Perform a variety of common networking tasks
** Backup
** Set a MOTD (Message of the day)
** Explore the routers physical configuration
** Configure a GRE Tunnel
** Configure routing

== Accessing your Lab


* Your instructor and facilitator will give you your unique student id
  `student1`, `student2` etc.,

* Begin by going to
  link:http://bit.ly/rhte-guidgrabber[http://bit.ly/rhte-guidgrabber]

* From this page select the proper Lab Code (A1008) for the current lab.

* Enter the Activation Key provided by the lab facilitator.

* Click Next. (Do this only once)

* The system will assign you a GUID(unique ID).

* The URL to your lab login credentials will be supplied

----
ssh student<NUM>@<IP Address>
----

* Password `ansible`

== Connect to your Control Host

[NOTE]
====
All examples below assume a login id of `student1`, please substitute your own
id provided to you, along with the IP address of your control node.

In addition *IP addresses* shown in command output and in
configuration files below will be different to yours.
====

. Before using `ssh` to  connect to your control node see if you can access the FinTech
  application itself by using your browser, or curl, to access the front end of the
application which is running on the Control Node itself.
+
Your URL should look like this: `http://<CONTROL_NODE_IP_ADDRESS`, the *same* IP
address that was supplied for your unique login. For example:
+
----
http://34.231.242.151/
----
+

Once the internal networks have been restored you would expect to see the
application itself, if not for now expect a *503* error message.

. `ssh` onto the Control Node from where you will be working with your login
  details provided by the above steps.
+
----
ssh student<number>@<IP_ADDRESS>
----
+
Your password is: `ansible`
+
. Explore your ansible configuration
+
----
[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible --version
----
+
----
ansible 2.8.4
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = [u'/home/student1/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.5 (default, May  3 2017, 07:55:04) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-14)]
----
+
[TIP]
====
Your output may differ slightly. You should see a recent version of Ansible (>
`2.8.4`) and you can see you are using the default `ansible.cfg` file which allows
you to customize behavior.
link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_configuration.html[ansible.cfg
documentation]
====
. Investigate how your `ansible.cfg` has been configured
+
----
[student1@ansible ~]$ cat /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
----
+
----
[defaults]
connection = smart
timeout = 60
host_key_checking = False
private_key_file = /home/student1/.ssh/aws-private.pem
----
+
[TIP]
====
This is a simple configuration and the lack of an `inventory` setting tells you
that Ansible will default to `/etc/ansible/hosts`. During the rest of this lab
you will be over-riding that `connection` setting when necessary to connect to
your routers.

----

. Note the Cisco group specific settings in the inventory file. In particular
  `ansible_network_os=ios`.
+
[TIP]
====
Ansible uses `ansible_network_os` to inform Ansible which network platform this hosts corresponds to. This is
required when using `connection` plugins `network_cli` or `netconf`. We will use be
using `connection: network_cli` later which is automatically combined with this.

Here for example `ansible_network_os=ios` tells Ansible the Networking Operating
System is Cisco's `ios`. Platforms supported by `ansible_network_os` include:

.`ansible_network_os` examples
|===
|Network Platform|`ansible_network_os`

|Arista EOS
|eos

|Cisco IOS

|Cisco IOS-XR

. Check Ansible can see the hosts in your inventory
+
----
[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible all --list-hosts
----
+
----
hosts (4):
    rtr1
    rtr2
    ansible
    host1
----
+
[TIP]
====
The `all` field in the previous command refers to the automatically created
group `all`. You can retry the command using another group name instead. For
example `cisco` or `dc`. Using Groups liberally in inventory files gives
flexibility in the long run and is considered a Best Practice.

with Inventory]
====


=== Investigate the Network Infrastructure

. Check if your host `ansible`  can connect to the `backend` server. `Control-c` will break out of this command when it fails to complete.
+
----
[student1@ansible ~]$ ping backend
PING backend (172.17.25.74) 56(84) bytes of data.
----

NOTE: The ping fails as your ansible control node `ansible` cannot find a route to `backend`.

. Check if you can connect to both routers using an ansible Ad-Hoc command
+
----
[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible cisco -m ping
----
+
[TIP]
====
Ansible supports calling modules directly from the command line via the
`ansible` command.  These are called Ad-Hoc commands and are often used to establish connectivity as in here
with the `ping` module. Another common use case is to inspect a host or group of hosts with fact gathering modules
like `setup`.

You can optionally pass parameters to Ad-Hoc commands with the `-a` option:
----
ansible localhost -m debug -a "msg='passing a parameter'"

----
====
+
. Note that the ping module, without additional parameters, is unable to successfully communicate with the Routers

----
. Retry the  `ansible ping` again selecting the `group` *cisco* and this time setting the connection type to
  `network_cli`

+
[NOTE]
====
By default Ansible connections are handled transparently by `ssh` and no
connection type needs to be set. This works well in a typical server environment
but typically not for network devices. However Ansible has a link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.6/plugins/connection.html[pluggable connection
architecture] which allows it be extended to connect to these and other devices.

Recently, in Ansible 2.5, support for `network_cli` and `NETCONF` improved, and
simplified, Ansible's network device connectivity. Both are also `ssh` based at their
core.

Other examples of `connection:` types include `local` when connecting to the localhost
 and `winrm` which allows Ansible to connect to Microsoft Windows platforms.

[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible cisco -m ping -c network_cli

        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
    },

}
rtr1 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
----

[TIP]
====

Here Ansible combines the connection type `-c network_cli` with the
`ansible_network_os=ios` inventory variable and now knows how to successfully
communicate with the network device.

Ansible allows you to pass variables like `ansible_network_os` on the command
line with the `-e` option and these have the highest precedence i.e. they will
override the setting in your inventory file.

You could try setting this to an illegal value, for example:

----
ansible cisco -m ping -c network_cli -e ansible_network_os=linux
----
You can also try setting it to a different vendors network operating system such
as `junos`, the result may at first be surprising. However `network_cli` uses
similar mechanisms to connect to network devices so a misconfiguration here
*may* not result in failure.

NOTE: A good practice here would be to add the setting `ansible_connection=network_cli` to your inventory.
For example in your `/etc/ansible/hosts`:
[source,ini]
----
[cisco:vars]
ansible_user=ec2-user
ansible_network_os=ios
ansible_connection=network_cli
----
This has the same effect as adding `connection: network_cli` to your playbooks or ad hoc commands. Note that when specified in an `inventory`
you need the prefix `ansible_`. By setting it at an inventory level you will no longer have to specify it via `-c` or in your playbooks. The remainder of the labs assume you have not set this. Feel free to chose your approach.
