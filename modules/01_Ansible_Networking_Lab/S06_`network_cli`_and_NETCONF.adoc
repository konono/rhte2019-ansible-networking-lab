Transcript:

Enhancements in Ansible 2.5 introduced 2 new connection plugins `network_cli`
and `NETCONF`. They make network connectivity more streamlined and playbooks
have a similar look and feel to Server playbooks.

Under the covers both use `ssh` as their transport

Today we will be using `network_cli` though as NETCONF matures and gains wider
adoption expect to see it more in the future.
