* *Most* network devices lack the ability to execute Python locally
* Linux Windows and other “server type” platforms execute the module code on
  _target_ device
* Network devices typically execute the module *on the control* node
** Commands and configuration are then sent to the device via a CLI session or an API

Transcript:

First one fundamental difference between how Ansible works in a server
environment and in a networking environment id where the modules actually
execute.

Servers have the capability of executing code locally via Python so typical
Ansible behavior is to connect via ssh, or WinRM for Windows platforms, and copy
the modules over for *local* execution.

Network devices don't always have this capability so the modules are executed
on the _Control Node_ and then each task is performed via cli or API calls to
the network device. Recent additions to Ansible though have made this largely
transparent to the operator.
