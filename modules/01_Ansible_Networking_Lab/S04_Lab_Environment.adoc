Transcript:

FinTech's topology is quite simple with 2 Data Centers: DC1 and DC2 which lack
their own dedicated private inter-connection. Traffic between the 2 sites is
routed across the Internet in a networking *Tunnel* created between 2 Cisco
routers, one on each site.

This GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) Tunnel between the 2 sites allows traffic to be simply routed back and forward between
the 2 data Centers as if they had a dedicated connection between the 2 sites.  FinTech's key application is split across the 2 sites and relies on this
connection

These routers have been hacked in a recent global attack aimed at publicly
exposed Cisco routers. Since then site-to-site communication has been broken
though insecure public Internet access exists to all externally exposed
machines.

Your job will be to regain control and re-configure the Network.

So a quick fly over of key Ansible features, plugins, and modules we will be
using today - in 5 slides.
