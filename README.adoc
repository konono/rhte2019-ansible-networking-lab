= Ansible Network Automation

== Lab Overview

In this lab you will you Ansible commands and playbooks to explore and
reconfigure a pair of Cisco routers in a cloud environment.

This will expose you to using Ansible to connect to, explore, and configure
Network Devices. We will introduce you to the communications plugin
`network_cli` and core Networking Modules including `ios_facts`, `ios_config`,`cli_config`,
`ios_command`, and `cli_command`. In addition throughout the labs we hope to show you common
features, elements, practices, and patterns in Ansible Playbook usage.

== Lab Outline

* link:./1_Ansible_Networking_Lab.adoc[Part 1: Explore the environment with Ansible]
- Explore the environment with shell and Ansible commands 
- Investigate Ansible's configuration and Inventory
- Connect to the Cisco Routers using Ansible 


* link:./2_Ansible_Networking_Lab.adoc[Part 2: Backup, Configure, and Explore the Routers facts]
- Use the `ios_config` Module in a Playbook to backup the routers
- Use the `ios_command` Module to investigate the router configuration
- Use the `ios_config` Module to start reconfiguration of the routers

* link:./3_Ansible_Networking_Lab.adoc[Part 3: Reconfigure the Routers to connect 2 sites]
- Use a Playbook with `cli_config` to create a GRE Tunnel
- Use a Playbook with various networking modules to configure routing
- Use `ios_config` to restore routers using the backups you created
- Create a `site.yml` to automate all previous stages into a single Playbook


* Bonus
- Create various Roles to better structure Parts 2 and 3 above
- Explore router configuration files and how to use with `cli_config`
